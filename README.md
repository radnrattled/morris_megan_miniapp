# Mini APP

This is a sample project using AJAX, Vue and Fetch to handle data from a database and show it on a click.. It's implemented with async / await and imported into the main JavaScript file as a module / component.

## Installation
Clone the repo to your local dev environment. This uses PHP on the back end, so you'll need something like WAMP or MAMP to run it (alternatively configure a Docker project and run it that way).


## Usage
Pretty straightforward - navigate to the live instance and Click on the Mini cars.

CSS is generated with SASS using the command line tools. You'll need dart-sass (preferred) - [you can get it here](https://sass-lang.com/install)
